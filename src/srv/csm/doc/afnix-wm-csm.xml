  <title>Standard Content Session Management Service</title>
  
  <p>
    The <em>Standard Content Session Management</em> service is an
    original implementation of various objects dedicated to the management
    of sessions, realms, identities and more generaly with data
    concentration in the form of binary blobs.

    <p>
      The <code>afnix-csm</code> provides the support for manipulating
      content session in an ecclectic form. There are multiple types of
      objects which can broadly be categorized into general data
      management in the form of data blobs, identity and credential
      management and finally session management.

      <p>
	The concept of blo=b is central in the <em>csm</em> service. A
	blob is a registrable part. A part is an abstract taggable
	object uniquely identified by a uuid. The blob adds a
	registration identification, which enables them to be group
	into domains.
