  <title>Standard Block Chain Engineering Service</title>
  
  <p>
    The <em>Standard Block Chain Engineering</em> service is an
    original implementation of various objects dedicated to the management
    of a block chain. At the bottom of the hierarchy is the the part
    which is assembled in a bill of parts (BOP). The bill is
    associated with a transaction which is time-stamped and
    signed. The transactions are linked together to form a chain.

	The concept of part is central in the <em>bce</em> service. A
	part is any serializable object which is used to assemble a
	bill of parts (BOP).
