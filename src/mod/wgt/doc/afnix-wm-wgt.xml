    <title>The conditional class</title>

    <p>
      The <code>Conditional</code> class is a widget class that
      provides a mechanism for conditional expression evaluation. A
      conditional object, if active, is valuated by evaluating the
      operator and the associated left and right operands. A
      conditional can also be defined by name and info.
    </p> 

    <example>
      const cond (afnix:wgt:Conditional "test" "test example")
    </example>

    <p>
      The conditional is defined with the <code>set</code> method which
      accepts one or two operands.
    </p>

    <example>
      cond:set "==" "x" 2
    </example>
